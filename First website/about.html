<p>The Components Of A Great About Us Page
  There isn’t a winning template to create a great About Us page. However, there are key components to make a convincing pitch with your brand story.
  
  Your Mission
  You don’t need to outright say, “our mission is ____,” but you should convey the mission of your business in your About Us copy. This is key for attracting talent, as well as leads that have Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) goals. 
  
  Your Social Proof
  Reviews, client logos, case studies, and results bring consistency to your About Us page. It’s what really proves what you are saying is real and the impact you can bring to future clients.With these components in mind, you will have a framework from which to build an engaging and unique About Us page.</p>
